# RetroHack-Salama-Edition
RetroHack: Salama Edition is a fast-paced, retro-style typing challenge where you play as Salama—a digital hero fighting to survive a wave of code snippets, glitchy pop-ups, and XP-era chaos. Master your typing, stay focused, and don’t let the system crash. Multilingual support included (EN/RU).
